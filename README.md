# Planner
Welcome to my weekly planner. This was my challenge for this week, I was supposed to make a responsive planner that was javascript dominant. This is technically a web api, allowing me to make this a web application. I am still working on my javascript skills and working on trying to find more effective and faster ways to improve my javascript skills. This challenge was quite challenging as I am submitting this a couple days past the submission date. I would rather submit this late and have it complete, then submit it on time and have a mess.

My planner allows you to set reminders to set up your busy days at work or a busy day as a mother. This api will have you planning ahead so that there is no worry about running late for another activity in the day.

Finally, I hope as a young new developer I can show my progress here on github as I progress as a learner and a student to becoming a full time developer hopefully, working for a start-up or maybe a bigger company. This planner was not my best work but as I go onto my first project next week and my weather app challenge for this week I will make better and better content.
